# Quant Study Resources

These are resources I compiled and used while preparing primarily for **quant research**
roles. The list is geared toward systematic equities and equity alpha research
(statistics, econometrics, time series, optimization, and market
microstructure), so it includes less on derivatives pricing and C++ focused
quant dev material. 

The resources below are unordered. I recommend starting with the guides ("On
Becoming a Quant," "The Green Book," and Keigo Hayashi's workshop) to map your
gaps, then going deeper on the areas that need the most work for your target
role. There are many more resources out there, and I did not study through every
item here in full. Treat this as a reference list and prioritize the most
important lectures or chapters for your needs.
