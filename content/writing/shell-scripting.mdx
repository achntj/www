The command line interface, with its powerful shell environments like Bash and
Zsh, allows you to interact with your computer using text-based commands. On
opening up your terminal, you’ll see a prompt where you can start typing
commands. Assuming your default shell is either Bash or Zsh, this tutorial
should work just fine.

### What is Bash?

Bash, short for "**B**ourne **A**gain **SH**ell," is a popular command-line
shell and scripting language used in Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS. It
provides a text-based interface for interacting with the operating system and
executing various commands.

### What is Zsh?

Zsh, short for "Z Shell," is another powerful command-line shell available as an
alternative to Bash. It offers additional features and customization options,
making it a popular choice for many users.

### Getting Started with Bash or Zsh

To begin, open your terminal. You can find it in your applications or use a
keyboard shortcut like `Ctrl + Alt + T` on most Linux distributions. On macOS,
you can find it in the "Utilities" folder within the "Applications" directory.

Once the terminal is open, you will see a prompt where you can start entering
commands. This is where it all begins!

### Basic Commands

Let’s start with some basic commands that you can try out in your terminal:

- `pwd` (Print Working Directory): This command displays the current directory
  you are in. For example, if you are in the home directory, running `pwd` will
  output `/home/username`.

- `ls` (List): Use this command to list the files and directories in the current
  directory. For example, running `ls` will display a list of files and
  directories in the current directory.

- `cd` (Change Directory): This command allows you to navigate to a different
  directory. For example, running `cd Documents` will change your current
  directory to the "Documents" directory.

- `mkdir` (Make Directory): Use this command to create a new directory. For
  example, running `mkdir myfolder` will create a new directory named "myfolder"
  in the current directory.

- `touch` (Create File): This command creates a new file. For example, running
  `touch myfile.txt` will create a new empty file named "myfile.txt" in the
  current directory.

Remember to press `Enter` after typing each command to execute it.

### Command Options and Arguments

Commands often come with options and arguments that modify their behavior.
Options are typically specified using a hyphen followed by a letter or word,
such as `-l` or `--help`. Arguments are additional information provided to a
command, such as a file or directory name.

For example:

- `ls -l`: Lists files in the long format. Here `-l` is the option being
  specified. Running `ls -l` will display detailed information about each file
  in the current directory, including permissions, owner, size, and modification
  date.

- `mkdir myfolder`: Creates a directory named "myfolder". Here `myfolder`
  is the argument. Running this command will create a new directory named
  "myfolder" in the current directory.

### Command History

Bash and Zsh keep track of the commands you’ve previously entered, allowing you
to access them easily. You can use the up and down arrow keys to navigate
through your command history. Press `Enter` to execute a previously entered
command.

### Tab Completion

Tab completion is a helpful feature that saves you from typing out long file or
directory names. When you start typing, press the `Tab` key, and the shell will
try to auto-complete the rest of the name for you. If there are multiple
possibilities, pressing `Tab` twice will show you the available options.

For better tab completions, auto-complete, and syntax highlighting you can
configure your `.zshrc` file. I have a [github
repository](https://github.com/achntj/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh) with sensible
defaults (in my opinion) and all the necessary configuration for a better
experience.

If you want to use a package instead you can look into ‘Oh My Zsh’.

### Scripting with Bash or Zsh

Bash and Zsh can also be used as scripting languages, allowing you to automate
tasks and create more complex programs. Shell scripts are plain text files with
a series of commands that can be executed together.

To create a script, open a text editor and save the file with a `.sh` extension
(e.g., `myscript.sh`). Make the file executable by running the command `chmod +x
myscript.sh`. Now, you can run the script by typing `./myscript.sh` in the
terminal.

### Final Thoughts

While there is much more to learn about Bash and Zsh, this guide should provide
you with a solid foundation to start exploring and using the command line
effectively. As you gain more experience, you can delve into advanced topics and
configurations to enhance your command-line experience even further.
