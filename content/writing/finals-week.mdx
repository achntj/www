Sixth finals week ever.  Worst lineup so far—five exams in five days. I’ve
handled busier weeks, but never five upper-division exams lined up to hit this
hard. These notes are a breadcrumb trail for future-me, proof that the week
happened the way memory will try to soften later.

### Saturday 

Operating Systems is in 48 hours, and Tuesday’s Financial Econ
sounds even worse right now.  On the side: one half-finished project, two
assignments, and a research paper that is far from finished. No room for clean
runs—just triage and forward motion. Writing this probably doesn’t help, yet
spelling out the chaos keeps it from feeling larger than it is.

### Monday-Tuesday 

Operating Systems—done.  

Financial Econ in thirteen hours. I open my notes and accept that sleep’s likely
off the schedule. The all-nighter always feels cinematic at first: silence thick
enough to wade through, and my brain swapping caffeine for sheer will. 

A few hours in: the glamour is gone—slides re-read start to look like
palimpsests, and I’m clocking twenty-minute detours into irrelevant footnotes
just to keep my eyes open. Every extra hour promised productivity; instead it
lent me a kind of slow-motion clarity, the feeling of thinking through honey. By
now I’m shuffling through slides at half speed, buying focus with music and the
second caffeine intake for the day.

It's 4 AM. Calling it. Two-hour nap, maybe three.

Exam is done. Energy-drink fog, sloppy arithmetic, but the thing is over.
All-nighters still feel heroic until the proctor hands out the test and your
neurons file for overtime pay.

### Wednesday

Intermediate Macro Economics today—technically optional, but I
sat for it anyway to lock in the grade. Down to two exams. Momentum’s thin—I
mostly orbit my desk, scrolling and pacing, waiting for this week to get over.

### Thursday

Distributed Systems went surprisingly well, but I’m wiped. I step
outside feeling scattered. One more to go. Compilers. Tomorrow. A final
all-nighter is inevitable, though I’m already running on fumes.

**11 PM**  Coffee tastes like regret; the parse tables in front of me might as
well be Sanskrit.

**2 AM**  Miserable and stuck.

**4 AM**  Resigned. I’m not learning, just orbiting the material and waiting for
sunrise to grant permission to stop.


### Friday

And it's done.

Campus parking already sounds much quieter for the first time all week. The
whole run was messy—bad sleep, too much Monster, take-out food, lecture slides
with corners curled from overuse—but it’s finished.

Will I miss it? Parts of it, yes. The late-night calm, the moment a tough
concept finally clicks, the way sunrise sneaks through blinds while you’re still
mid-problem. Mostly I’m glad to breathe without a countdown in my ear.
